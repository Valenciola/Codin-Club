# Codin-Club
Coding Club projects and exploring uncharted (at least personally) territories
<br>
*(Actually the name of the repo is Codin' Club but you know character rules)*

**ANYHOW** yes I guess I'm making some cool-ish (hopefully) programs in here in which I use programming languages that isn't JavaScript (or HTML, although I hear that's not a programming language)...
<br>
So currently, we have delved into the following...
- Python

***What is this foreign universe*** anyway Python doesn't use semicolons which is super weird and also like the commas in strings add spaces to themselves and this is all super unusual so either I do some research or I just sit in the dark like this...

*What do we need Python for again?*
